    "are usually unable to find routes that span over multiple locations while carrying multiple types\n",
    "of cargo. Furthermore, given the current state of supply in the game, the existing tools are also\n",
    "unable to account for the expected low supply on highly profitable goods. Thus, by explicitly modeling\n",
    "the problem in the language of optimization, some of these issues may be addressed."

    "# Problem Description\n",
    "Since SC is a space sim, there are no \"roads\" that has to be considered. Each buyer/seller\n",
    "can be directly reached from every other buyer/seller via quantum jump. The stopping points during\n",
    "quantum jumps are empty space, and are meant to get around obstacles. In general, quantum\n",
    "jumping within a planetary system does not take much time. However, quantum jumping between planets,\n",
    "and to Lagrange points takes a longer period of time. At each stop, there are a set\n",
    "of commodities that can be bought and sold at a price. Furthermore, there's a limited demand and\n",
    "supply for each commodities, as well as a limit in the amount of available cargo space. Since\n",
    " there's a limited supply/demand, it would not be feasible to visit the same location multiple times\n",
    " on single trade run. Thus, each location should be visited at most once. Additionally, it is not\n",
    " necessary that the player starts and stop at the same location, but it can be a\n",
    "desirable feature. Finally, it is also not necessary that the player starts from a specific location.\n",
    "This implies that the trade route problem here is a variant of the vehicle routing problem(VRP) with the\n",
    "added factor of how much cargo to purchase and sell. The problem is NP-hard,\n",
    "but it can be formulated as a mixed integer programming problem under the decision theory framework."
